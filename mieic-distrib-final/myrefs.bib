@article{House2009,
	abstract = {In the last few years Software as a Service (SaaS) has changed from curiosity generating concept to an accepted mainstream concept. SaaS has transformed the way software is being delivered to the customer. This transformation has been possible with maturing technologies and the web becoming the primary medium of communication and collaboration. SaaS is a software delivery paradigm where the software is hosted off-premise and delivered via web to a large number of tenants and the mode of payment follows a subscription model. Configurability is one of the keystones to the success of any SaaS software. Configurability allows the single instance multiple tenant model which leads to many benefits both for the customers and the vendors which in turn has led to the acceptance and popularity of SaaS. Configurability in SaaS software aims to provide tenants/customers with a multitude of options and variations using a single code base, such that it is possible for each tenant to have a unique software configuration. How to capture and represent configuration data is an important consideration when designing for configurability in SaaS software. This paper addresses the issue of how to effectively and efficiently support configurability in SaaS software and proposes SaaS architecture to support configurability. A proof of concept implementation is done to support configurability with the configuration data in xml format. The paper aims to provide information on the nature of configurability in SaaS software, how it can be provided and the technologies needed to support it.},

@article{Abrahamsson2002,
	abstract = {Agile denoting the quality of being agile; readiness for motion; nimbleness, activity, dexterity in motion software development methods are attempting to offer an answer to the eager business community asking for lighter weight along with faster and nimbler software development processes. This is especially the case with the rapidly growing and volatile Internet software industry as well as for the emerging mobile application environment. The new agile methods have evoked a substantial amount of literature and debates. However, academic research on the subject is still scarce, as most of existing publications are written by practitioners or consultants. The aim of this publication is to begin filling this gap by systematically reviewing the existing literature on agile software development methodologies. This publication has three purposes. First, it proposes a definition and a classification of agile software development approaches. Second, it analyses ten software development methods that can be characterized as being agile against the defined criteria. Third, it compares these methods and highlights their similarities and differences. Based on this analysis, future research needs are identified and discussed.},
