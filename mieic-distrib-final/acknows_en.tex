\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First of all i would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Professor Doutor João Pascoal Faria, for an excellent guidance, patience, and for sharing his extensive knowledge.

A special thanks to my supervisor from Strongstep, César Duarte, for his guidance, availability, suggestions and for always believing in my work.

I would never have been able to finish my thesis without the guidance of all the members from the company that welcomed me in this process, in particular Anabela Esteves for helping me with the conception and the implementation and for being always available to all of my questions even the dumb ones, Jessica Teixeira, for making this work a little more "prettier" and user friendly and Rita Cunha for the advices and suggestions and the some work in a short time.

Last but not least, i would like to thank my family and close friends, they were always supporting me and encouraging me with their best wishes.
